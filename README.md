# OptimizationUnderUncertainty

This project contributes to the field of optimization under uncertainty, specifically addressing challenges in production planning production, taking inspiration from available literature on scheduling problems. The study explores two distinct analytical approaches: a naive method involving multiple runs and a robust optimization approach. The naive approach provides valuable insights into the impact of uncertainty on profits, showcasing variations in different scenarios. On the other hand, the robust optimization approach introduces a systematic and computationally efficient methodology that ensures feasibility under specified uncertainty levels.
Through the mathematical formulation of a Production Planning Problem (PPP), this research illuminates the complexities of decision-making in the presence of incomplete knowledge. The naive approach, relying on multiple runs with varied scenarios, sheds light on the variability of profits under different conditions. However, it lacks the systematic control over robustness that the robust optimization approach offers.
The robust optimization approach, with its foundation in mathematical rigor, introduces a trade- off  between  optimality  and  robustness.  Decision-makers  can  fine-tune  the  degree  of conservatism, providing solutions that remain feasible even under uncertain conditions. This approach is computationally efficient, reducing the need for repetitive computations and offering a reliable framework for decision-making. Though modelling under this approach and probabilistic bounding is quite rigorous and time consuming.
